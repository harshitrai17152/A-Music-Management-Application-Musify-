# A-Music-Management-Application-Musify-
Our project involves developing a Music Management Application named ‘Musify’ that provides its users with a variety of songs to listen to based on their choices of mood, genre, language, artist and film. This Application also provides support to a variety of artists to showcase their art to the audience by adding their newly sung/composed songs for our users and earn. The filmmakers also have the option to upload all the songs of their films.  The songs can be rated by the users and also added to the list of favorite songs for the users. A user logs into the Application with LoginID and Password. He/she is also given the option of availing for a subscription and upgrade to a premium user, if a normal user.  The Application also supports additional benefits like display of lyrics and image along with the song being played.
